I tried mass-producing emails in hopes that I would benefit
from economies of scale, but that felt a bit stressful and
unnatural. So I'm going to try doing hand-crafted artisinal
emails instead. More specifically, I'm periodically (like
weekly or daily) going to choose a person at random to email.

The colloquial use of the word "random" tends to imply random
sampling with equal probabilties, but I want to do something
a bit more involved; the present system selects the person
to email based on my previous email communications.
