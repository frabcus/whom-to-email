I like to know what my friends lives are like, and they seem
to like to know what mine is like, so I like to send them emails
about what my life is like.

Motivation
============
I tried mass-producing emails in hopes that I would benefit
from economies of scale, but that felt a bit stressful and complicated and
unnatural. So I'm going to try doing hand-crafted artisinal
emails instead. More specifically, I'm periodically (like
weekly or daily) going to choose a person at random to email.

Sampling method
=================
The colloquial use of the word "random" tends to imply random
sampling with equal probabilties, but I want to do something
a bit more involved; the present system selects the person
to email based on my previous email communications.

My goal is to put higher weights on people who I know very
well and haven't talked to in a while.

How to use
==============
To select a person, just run ``make``.

You (I) will probably want to edit the weighting function
quite a bit. The function is just something I made up, not
based on any interesting theory or training data. Edit it
by editing the ``weights`` function in ``sample.R``.
Then run ``sample.R`` and look at the
``data/*/weight{-change,}s.pdf`` files to get a feel for
whether you came up with a decent weighting.

The entry point for the whole thing is the ``Makefile``,
so start there if you want to change anything else.

Things to try
==============

* Get separate fields for messages from me and messages
  to me, and weight people based on that. My guess is
  that people with similar numbers for both of these are
  more of the sort that I want to email.
* Come up with some way of checking that the weighting is
  good other than doing the random sampling a bunch of
  times.
* Deal with people who have changed email addresses.
